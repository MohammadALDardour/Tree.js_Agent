### Reporting Issues and Suggesting New Features

We value your feedback! Whether you’ve found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please help us keep our project robust and user-friendly by following these guidelines:

1. **Search for Existing Issues:**
   - Before opening a new issue, please search our [Issues](https://github.com/MohammadALDardour/Tree.js_Agent/issues) to see if someone else has already reported the problem or suggested a similar feature.

2. **Creating a New Issue:**
   - Click the "New Issue" button on our repository’s Issues page.
   - Use the provided issue template (if available) to include:
     - A clear and descriptive title.
     - A detailed description of the problem or feature request.
     - Steps to reproduce the issue (for bugs).
     - Expected versus actual behavior.
     - Relevant environment details (e.g., OS, browser version, etc.) if applicable.
     - Any additional context, screenshots, or logs that might help us understand the issue.

3. **Labeling and Categorization:**
   - Apply appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) to your issue. If you’re not sure which label to use, leave it to the maintainers to categorize it after submission.

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - Once your issue is submitted, please monitor it for any follow-up questions or requests for clarification from the maintainers.
   - Feel free to update your issue with any additional information if needed.

5. **Community Discussions:**
   - For broad ideas or feature discussions, consider starting a conversation in our [Discussions](https://github.com/your-repo/discussions) section to collaborate with other community members.

Your contributions help improve the project for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to report issues and suggest new features!
